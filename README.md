## Background 
#### *Purpose of Low Fidelity Prototyping and User Research*
This type of user research is very important. Mapping out exactly how a website will function is an integral step in creating a website that will be functional to the user. Low fidelity prototyping and wire flows are essential in testing how screens will work and how the user will use them. Getting in touch with the user and testing the flows and bring up issues that may not have been noticed before, but now after observing how a viewer uses the screen can help improve usability. 

### *Persona* 
Beth is a middle aged woman who lives in the desert and has weather that constantly fluctuates throughout the day. Being in the desert it is also very dry and makes drought an issue, but also makes wildfires a hazard. She uses weather.gov to check these features.

### *Tasks*
The three scenarios chosen for this task are:
1. Finding the hourly weather, a simplified version and one that is more detailed. 
2. Checking to see the status of drought in her area.
3. Checking to see if her area is in a wildfire watch or warning. 
* all tasks ended with the ability to navigate back home as well.

## Task 1

**_Hourly Forecast_**

The purpose of this task is to navigate from the home page to find the hourly weather report for her current location. This is as function of the website that needed to be changed because, the text to find the hourly weather was originally very hard to find. Also the hourly information presented was in a very hard to read graph. Not conducive to a fast, easy check. To remedy this, a new page would be created that presents the hourly forecast in a chart with the basic information: time, temperature, and icon. Users are able to click on the arrow at the right edge of the screen to view the next hours, that did not fit on the screen. There is still the option to have the detailed hourly forecast, underneath the new chart on a new page, for those users who want to know more, detailed hourly weather information.

**_User Comments_**

The user was slightly confused doing this task. They wanted to skip screens and go to the final page. The user commented in orange: “do I go through this to get to [hourly weather forecast]?” The flow of the website, I think, was confusing to the user. The font sizes would be larger and clearer, because I think my user skipped over the “Hourly Forecast” section to click on to find the page with that information. The user was able to successfully complete the task. 

## Task 2

**_Wildfires_**

The second task was to check wildfire watch and warning in the US and to see if an area of concern was under either of these. The issue with this function is that the map that comes up with highlighted areas did not have a key to be able to distinguish the colors. Also the map is fixed, so the user only sees the area that is zoomed in on, rather than a whole United States map in which the user can zoom in and out of different areas.

**_User Comments_**

In the wire flow the user worked backwards to figure out how to get to the end page. I ended up having to explain more simply and clearly how the task worked, going from each page that users have to navigate through to get to the end page. For this task the user had to navigate through “Safety” so I think it might be a good idea in the future to have “Safety” on the top bar change text color or have the background highlighted so the user knows where they are in the website. The user was able to successfully complete the task.

## Task 3

**_Drought_**

Task 3 is to find the drought status for the users area of choice. As it is now, to find this the user has to navigate to resources on the side and click on “US Drought Monitor” this then takes the user out of the weather.gov page and to drought.gov. I think this can be confusing to the user because now they are on a different website that they did not go to and the functions do not work the same. I think that it would be better to have a widget from drought.gov in the weather.gov page that the user can input their information and get a simpler answer. If the user wants more detailed info, that is when they can go to the drought.gov page in “Resources”.

**_User Comments_**

After a better explanation of the wireflow, the user got the hang of it. The user still was not sure which page came first though. The user commented “not sure which page comes first” in green. I do not know if this is confusion from the task of having different page drawings or if the usability sequence is off. This made it kind of confusing for the user. Also, the user commented and thinks the placement of the drought widget should be located at the top of the page and not at the bottom. The user was able to successfully complete the task.

## Reflection 

To begin, next time I will properly explain what the wireframe/wireflow is to the tester. After being in a class and learning about these things, they come to be basic knowledge and I forget that before this class I did not know what many of these things were and that my user is currently is this frame of mind as well. I think it might also be better to write things larger. I struggled with how large to make the writing and what I should include as something that gets written out vs. something that gets squiggled for the sake of space in a small “frame”. I also think a feature that highlights or changes the text color of the heading the user clicks on would be a good idea to have to indicate to the user where they are in the website. I am also not sure if the issues that arose were from the task not being clear or the webpage design not being clear. For future projects it would be good to do this more times to get a clearer answer on this. 


* Though it may seem menial, the home button does not take the user back to the home page, but goes back one page, like a back arrow. It was important to show that the home button would take the user back to the original home page.
